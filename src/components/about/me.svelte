    <Title>A Little About Me</Title>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Calvin and I am a senior software engineer at <a
            href="https://www.postgrid.com"
            target="_blank"
            class="text-teal-400 hover:text-teal-200 transition ease-out"
            aria-label="A link to PostGrid, where I work">PostGrid</a
        >. I first got into programming when I was in highschool where I was
        making silly little games in some language I cannot even remember.
        Finding enjoyment in this, I went to college for web design which is
        where I found out that I am pretty awful at design but pretty good at
        programming. I went ahead and finished that degree and got another
        degree as a Computer Programming Analyst and a Bachelors of Computer
        Science.

        During my free time you could often catch me biking, reading,
        programming random things, or playing games, which I even competed as
        captain of my school's collegiate Overwatch team during my time as a
        student.
